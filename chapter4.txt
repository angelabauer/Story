It was the time of UFOs, it was the time of little green men (and women).

The little green men (and women) had made a deal with the aliens long time back. 

All humanoid civilization had this strange attraction to plastic and would end up creating loads of plastic waste. Green men (and women) needed this plastic as plastic was their main source of carbs. Their digestive systems weren't capable of breaing down starches like ramen and chao fan, and thier world lacked oil, so they pretty much had to survive on natural polymers. They were peaceful and more importantly just type 0.7 civilization in capable of interstellar travel.  

In comes in the aliens who decided against interbreeding, not because the little green men (and women) were ugly as fuck, but their world had the opposite problem - it was too clean. Hence aliens struck a deal with the little green men (and women), that they would be happy to supply little green men (and women) with plastic. Aliens would get Thorium or Gold in return.

Aliens would eventually discover there was lot of civilizations and worlds that need plastic for survival and their understanding of the 11 dimenstion would help them traverse to these worlds and create "natural" deposits of plastic for the type 0.5 - 0.7 sentient civilizations to discover. For systems where there were no sentient lifes, or life was in early stages of evolution, aliens just spread the plastic around.

Aliens would have incorporated the genetic changes needed to enable humanoid civilization to survice on plastic, but it was just so terrible tasting that, they decided it would be better give it to little, green, blue, yellow and purple men (and women) in exchange for Thorium or Gold, rather than play God.
